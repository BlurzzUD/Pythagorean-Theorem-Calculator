## Features

- 🟢 **Calculate any missing side**: Input any two sides (a, b, or c) to automatically calculate the third.
- 🎨 **Interactive triangle visualization**: Displays a right triangle with labeled sides updated in real-time.
- 📜 **Step-by-step calculation display**: Shows the detailed calculation process for better understanding.
- 🌐 **Multi-language support**: Currently supports English, Hungarian, German, French, Spanish, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, and Simplified Chinese.
- 🖥️ **Responsive design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- 🔄 **Clear all**: Reset inputs and results with a single click.

## How It Works

1. Enter any **two side lengths** in the input fields (`a`, `b`, or `c`).
2. The calculator automatically computes the missing side.
3. The triangle diagram and side labels update in real-time.
4. Detailed calculation steps appear below the triangle for educational purposes.

**Formula used:**  

\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\]

- `a` and `b` are the legs (shorter sides)
- `c` is the hypotenuse (longest side)

## Usage

1. Open the **live demo** above or download/clone the repository.
2. Select your preferred language from the dropdown menu.
3. Enter values for any two sides of the triangle.
4. View the result and step-by-step solution.
5. Click **Clear All** to reset the inputs.

### Example

- Input: `a = 3`, `b = 4`
- Output: `c = 5`  
- Calculation displayed:
a² + b² = c²
3² + 4² = c²
9 + 16 = c²
c = √25
c = 5
